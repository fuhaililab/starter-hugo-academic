Fuhai Li, PhD, is an assistant professor of pediatrics and institute for informatics (I2).
Dr. Fuhai Li’s research interest is the development and applications of network/graph-based computational and artificial intelligence (AI) models to analyze the big data of pharmacogenomics in the biomedical research field. These computational models, combing with experimental validations, can predict and rank theraputic targets, drugs and drug combinations for treating complex diseases, in a fast and cost-effecitve manner. Along with the advent of next-generation sequencing and highthroughput profiling technologies, (big data) large-scale tissue-level and single-cell level omics data of complex diseases have been generated to uncover key molecular targets and core signaling pathways regulating the disease development and predict personalized precision medicine. Though a set of novel targets and mechanisms have been uncovered using these valuable datasets, the pathogenesis, therapeutic targets, and associated complex signaling cascades remain unclear. And there is no effective and curable medication for many complex diseases, like cancer, alzheimer’s disease (AD), COVID-19, longevity, and many other diseases. It is challenging to identify effective medications from thounsands of drugs and compound agents, or from millions of possible drug combination candidates. Therefore, novel computational models that can integrate and interpret the large-scale omics and pharmacogenomics data to predict and prioritize the key therapeutic targets and medications, have been a critical component in the development of precision medicine. Dr. Li has developed and applied a set of computational models for signaling network biomarker, drug and drug combination prediction by integrating disease omics data and pharmacogenomics data of drugs, as in dicated in his scientific publications. For example, he developed network module based drug and drug combination prediction models, in which the signaling network and protein-protein interactions were integrated with omics data and pharmacogenocmis data of thousands of drugs, to infer disease signaling network modules and predict potentiall effective drugs. By applying these models to melanoma skin cancer, a set of drugs and novel drug combinations were predicted and validated to be able to reduce drug resistance. These models were also applied to COVID-19, in which he uncovered core host signaling networks of COVID-19, and predicted drugs and drug combinations for COVID-19, and identified novel pathogenesis between female sex hormone and COVID-19 mortality. Moreover, the weakly activated inflammation signaling pathways and associated medications, using these models, were also identified in his studies in Alzheimer’s disease. He also developed computational models and tools to analyze single cell RNA-seq data to identify cell type specific signaling targets, and multi-cell signaling interactions, and predict drugs/drug combinations for perturbing the disease microenivonments. In his recent studies, he further improve these computational models by developing a set of novel graph-AI models, which can better integrate multi-omics data, rank key molecular targets, infer the core signaling pathways, and uncover the mechanisms of effective drugs and drug combinations. Because of the impact and innovation of his research on the computational models, Dr. Li obtained 4 PI/Multi-PI NIH funding awards, which all focus on discovering key disease molecular targets, infering core signaling pathways, predict therapeutic targets and effective drugs and syerngistic drug combinations. Moreover, he also applied his AI knowledge and developed AI models to analyze video, EEG and vital sign data, to predict and detect the seizure and mortality of preterms in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), which remain exceptional burdens of extremely preterm birth.
